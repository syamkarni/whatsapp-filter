## About

Have you ever wanted to quickly **catch up** on what's happening in your WhatsApp group,  
but felt overwhelmed seeing **500+ unread messages** from just the last few hours?

This tool is built exactly for that.

---

## Why this tool?

While **AI** models today can summarize chats,  
they still have **input size limitations** — meaning,  
you **cannot upload huge WhatsApp chat files directly** to an AI at once.

To solve this, this application:

- **Filters** your WhatsApp exported chat `.txt` file
- **Selects only the messages** between the **start** and **end** date-time you choose
- **Creates a smaller, more relevant file** ready for AI summarization, analysis, or even manual reading

---

## How it works

1. **Upload** your WhatsApp exported `.txt` chat file.
2. **Select** a **Start Date-Time** and **End Date-Time**.
3. **Download** a new `.txt` file containing only the filtered messages.
4. **Feed** the smaller file into your favorite AI tool or just read it directly!
